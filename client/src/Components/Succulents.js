      <h2>Care Tips for Succulents</h2>
      <p>
        Caring for succulents is generally straightforward, but understanding their needs will ensure they thrive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Light:</strong> Succulents love bright, indirect sunlight. Place them near a window where they can receive plenty of light but avoid direct, harsh sun that could scorch their leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Water:</strong> The key to succulent care is to allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering is the most common mistake, so it's better to underwater than to overwater.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Soil:</strong> Use well-draining soil designed for cacti and succulents. You can also add sand or perlite to regular potting soil to improve drainage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Temperature:</strong> Succulents prefer warmer temperatures and can tolerate a range of conditions, but they should be protected from frost.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fertilizer:</strong> Feed succulents with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during their growing season (spring and summer) to encourage healthy growth.

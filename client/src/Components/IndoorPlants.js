        <li><strong>Stress Reduction:</strong> Being around greenery can help lower stress levels and improve mental well-being.</li>

      <p><strong>Tips for Caring for Indoor Plants:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Light:</strong> Ensure your plants get the right amount of light. Some plants thrive in low light, while others need bright, indirect sunlight.</li>
        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Overwatering is a common mistake. Allow the soil to dry out between watering for most indoor plants.</li>
        <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Some plants prefer higher humidity levels. Consider misting them or placing them near a humidifier.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Use well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Specialized potting mixes are available for specific plant types.</li>
      </ul>
